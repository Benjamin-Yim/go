// OS memory management abstraction layer
// OS 内存管理抽象层
//
// Regions of the address space managed by the runtime may be in one of four
// states at any given time:
// 1) None - Unreserved and unmapped, the default state of any region.
// 2) Reserved - Owned by the runtime, but accessing it would cause a fault.
//               Does not count against the process' memory footprint.
// 3) Prepared - Reserved, intended not to be backed by physical memory (though
//               an OS may implement this lazily). Can transition efficiently to
//               Ready. Accessing memory in such a region is undefined (may
//               fault, may give back unexpected zeroes, etc.).
// 4) Ready - may be accessed safely.
//
// 1) None - 内存没有被保留或者映射，是地址空间的默认状态.
// 2) Reserved - 运行时持有该地址空间，但是访问该内存会导致错误.
// 3) Prepared - 内存被保留，一般没有对应的物理内存访问该片内存的行为是未定义的可以快速转换到 Ready 状态.
// 4) Ready - 可以被安全访问.
//
// This set of states is more than is strictly necessary（必要） to support all the
// currently（目前） supported platforms. One could get by with just None, Reserved, and
// Ready. However, the Prepared state gives us flexibility（灵活） for performance（执行）
// purposes（作用）. For example, on POSIX-y operating systems, Reserved is usually a
// private anonymous mmap'd region with PROT_NONE set, and to transition
// to Ready would require setting PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE. However the
// underspecification of Prepared lets us use just MADV_FREE to transition from
// Ready to Prepared. Thus with the Prepared state we can set the permission
// bits just once early on, we can efficiently tell the OS that it's free to
// take pages away from us when we don't strictly need them.
//
// This file defines a cross-OS interface for a common set of helpers
// that transition memory regions between these states. The helpers call into
// OS-specific implementations that handle errors, while the interface boundary
// implements cross-OS functionality, like updating runtime accounting.

// sysAlloc transitions an OS-chosen region of memory from None to Ready.
// More specifically, it obtains a large chunk of zeroed memory from the
// operating system, typically on the order of a hundred kilobytes
// or a megabyte. This memory is always immediately available for use.
//
// sysStat must be non-nil.
//
// Don't split the stack as this function may be invoked without a valid G,
// which prevents us from allocating more stack.
// 会从操作系统中获取一大块可用的内存空间，可能为几百 KB 或者几 MB；

// longer needed and can be reused for other purposes. The contents of a

// may be safely accessed. This is typically a no-op on systems that don't have
// an explicit commit step and hard over-commit limits, but is critical on
// Windows, for example.
//
// This operation is idempotent for memory already in the Prepared state, so
